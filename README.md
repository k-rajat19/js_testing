# About
- `testing-app` is a JavaScript testing framework based on [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) architecture.
- It is build using some of `jest` packages.

<br/>I've decided to make this project to understand how `jest` internally works. 
<br/> Thanks to [Christoph Nakazawa](https://github.com/cpojer) for explaining the `jest` architecture as it helps me to make this project and to contribute in `jest` as well.
